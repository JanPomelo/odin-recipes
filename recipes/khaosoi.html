    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat; cook
        and stir chopped shallots and garlic until garlic starts to turn golden,
        2 to 4 minutes. Add red curry paste and curry powder; cook and stir
        until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add coconut milk, water, chicken, and
        sea salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer soup.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix fish sauce, sugar, and lime juice into soup and simmer until heated
        through, about 10 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1/2 cup oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; fry Thai chile
        peppers until browned, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer chile peppers to soup,
        reserving oil in skillet. Fry quartered shallots and bok choy in hot oil
        until browned, 2 to 4 minutes; transfer to soup and reserve oil in
        skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Set aside until
        noodles are softened, about 15 minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly. Add
        3/4 of the noodles to the soup. Fry the remaining rice noodles in the
        hot oil until crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>

        Divide soup among 6 bowls and top with fried noodles, pickled cabbage,
        cilantro, and lime wedges.

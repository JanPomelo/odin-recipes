# odin-recipes

This project is about showing some receipts. It includes a main page, showing what the recipes are about. It also includes some more pages which have detailed informations about the recipes.

In this project, I will use all the HTML knowledge I learned in the previous lessons from The Odin Project. This includes the following tasks

- building a webpage with a basic HTML structure
- handling several tags like headings, paragraphs, links and images
- create a structured project folder
